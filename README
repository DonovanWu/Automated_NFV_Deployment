This project aims to deploy NFV components automatically on different VMs.

TODO:
The provision script currently fails to patch eNB and it also fails to build 3rd party software as they require interaction.

SOLUTION:
We can download all the 3rd party dependency beforehand and run the build without "-i" flag afterwards.
This will allow the 3rd party integrations to get installed without user interaction.

For the eNB patching error, I have left a comment on the blog post and hopefully we will get a respone.

HOW DOES IT WORK:
cd into this directory and run setup.sh script.
The script will download virtual box and vagrant.
It will then deploy Ubuntu17.04 VM and start updating and upgrading it. It'll then start to automatically install the softwares as specified in the provision script under vm_provision.

Note: It fails at the end because the dependency are not installed and we cannot interact with the setup.

Basic Commands:

vagrant ssh (To login into the vm)
vagrant destroy <ID> (To destroy the VM)
vagrant box remove <VM_NAME> (To remove the VM)
vagrant box list (To list all the VMs)
